### Project Description
Bubble Popper is an interactive game where users pop virtual bubbles for fun. It‚Äôs a simple, yet oddly satisfying way to pass the time by clicking on bubbles that pop and reappear with a fun "pop" sound effect!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt the overwhelming frustration of having no bubbles to pop when you're bored? The agony of unpopped bubbles just sitting there, mocking you? Yeah, we thought so.
